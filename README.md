# CSST Analyzer

CSST analyzer takes Crystal 16 data in from a csv file, automatically extracts the 
RPM, polymers, solvents, concentration, and transmission vs time and temperature vs time.

## TODO

- [x] Copy code from CSST\_App for data loading
    - [x] Explain how old code works for importing data
    - [x] Write test cases for importation
- [x] Implement transmission averaging based on temp
- [ ] Mona add TODOs
